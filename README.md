## Why do I need Tourguide.js

Every time you build you next awesome web app, you sit back and stare lovingly at your handy-work :) But then inevitably someone comes along asking one and the same inconvenient question: _"So, how do I use it?"_

You try to explain, but people are just not getting it! You write [how-tos](https://docsie.io), [lengthy docs](https://docsie.io), and [step-by-step guides](https://docsie.io), and yet, nothing seems to be enough.

This is why we built **Tourguide.js** - a simple yet powerful explainer utility, designed to help you make the reply a little bit less painful. Because, let's face it - picture is worth a 1000 words:

## Getting started

There are a few ways you can use **Tourguide.js**

### Fiddle with it

Want to see how it works right away? [Try on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/eugenetrue/q465gb7L/)

### CommonJS

Download `tourguide.min.js`, add it to your project libraries, and then include it on page:

```
<script src="tourguide.min.js"></script>
```

### ES Module support

If you use ES modules in your project ([Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org)) import **Tourguide.js** like so:

```
import Tourguide from "tourguidejs";
```

## Usage

Before use, **Tourguide.js** must be instantiated:

```
var tourguide = new Tourguide({options});
```

- `root`: root element the tour steps will attach to; default is document.body

- `selector`: if you want to use content based tour approach you can use this option to specify the common selector for the tour steps; default is `[data-tour]`

- `animationspeed`: speed of all tour built-in animations; default is 300

- `padding`: additional padding to add to step highlighter; default is 5(px)

- `align<'top' | 'bottom' | 'center'>`: the vertical alignment of the tour targets. default is 'top'

- `steps`: if you choose to take JSON based tour approach provide use this property to provide the data; default is null

- `src`: if you want to load the tour from a remote URL you may specify it here; default is null

- `preloadimages`: if you want to preload images, you may set this attribute to true; default is false

- `restoreinitialposition`: if you want to restore the scroll position after the tour ended, you may set this attribute to true; default is true

- `colors`: if you want to customize the color schema of this plugin, use this attribute. object will be combine with default values.

  Here is the defult

  ```json
  {
    "overlay": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)",
    "background": "#fff",
    "bullet": "#ff4141",
    "bulletVisited": "#aaa",
    "bulletCurrent": "#b50000",
    "stepButtonPrev": "#ff4141",
    "stepButtonNext": "#ff4141",
    "stepButtonComplete": "#b50000"
  }
  ```

- `keyboardNavigation`: if you want to enable keyboard navigation, use this attribute. each attribute can be number, string or object.
  If you want to disable the keyboard navigation, just set this option to `false`.

  - number - used as `keyCode` : [DEPRECATED](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode)
  - string - used as `key`
  - object - All KeyboardEvent attribute is accepted including `keyCode`, `altKey`, `metaKey`, `ctrlKey` and etc.
    View This doc for more details about the KeyboardEvent: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent

  Here is the default

  ```json
  {
    "next": "ArrowRight",
    "prev": "ArrowLeft",
    "first": "Home",
    "last": "End",
    "complete": null,
    "stop": "Escape"
  }
  ```

- `request`: if you want to load the tour from a remote URL you may provide request headers here

- `onStart`: callback function triggered when the tour starts

- `onStop`: callback function triggered when tour stops

- `onComplete`: callback triggered when tour completes

- `onStep`: callback triggered when a tour step is shown

- `onAction`: callback triggered when the user-defined action processed. see [onAction](#onAction) for more detail.

Once instantiated you can use tourguide instance a several different ways:

### Content based approach

Simplest approach is to read the descriptions right off the elements on page. This works best if you are using an [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) approach in your application. Simply add tour descriptions to the [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) elements in your page template:

```
<button aria-label="Collaborate" data-tour="step: 1; title: Step1; content: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet">
  Collaborate
</button>
```

In this mode you can simply use **Tourguide.js** as-is:

```
var tourguide = new Tourguide();
tourguide.start();
```

About step details, See [Step](#Step) section.

### JSON based approach

You may also write your own steps definition using [JSON](https://www.json.org/) notation:

```
`[`
`  {`
`    "selector": null,`
`    "step": 1,`
`    "title": "Lets take a moment and look around Docsie library",`
`    "content": "Click a button to advance to the next step of this tour.<br/> To stop this tour at any time click a button in the top-right corner.",`
`    "image": "https://somehost.com/image.jpeg"`
`  },`
`  {`
`    "selector": "[data-component=library]:first-of-type",`
`    "step": 2,`
`    "title": "Shelf",`
`    "content": "Just like a real library &lt;mark&gt;Docsie&lt;/mark&gt; starts with &lt;dfn&gt;shelves&lt;/dfn&gt;. Each &lt;dfn&gt;shelf&lt;/dfn&gt; represnts a separate collection of ideas. You may think of them as individual websites, or website sections."`
`  }`
`]`
```

Once you have the complete JSON description for each of your tour steps you will have to initialize **Tourguide.js** passing your JSON as `steps:` property:

```
var steps = [...];
var tourguide = new Tourguide({steps: steps});
tourguide.start();
```

About step details, See [Step](#Step) section.

### Remote URL approach

You may also want to load the steps remotely. To do so simply provide the target `src` as one of the **Tourguide.js** init params:

```
var tourguide = new Tourguide({src: "https://somedomain.com/tours/guide.json"});
tourguide.start();
```

About step details, See [Step](#Step) section.

### Step

- `selector?<string>`: [CSS selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) used to find the target element _(used on JSON based approach and Remote URL approach)_

- `step<number>`: tour step sequence number

- `title<string>`: tour step title

- `marked?<boolean>`: if content is markdown, you may set this attr to true; default false.

- `content<string>`: tour step description. if `marked` is `true`, you can write the content with [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language.

- `image?<url>`: tour step illustration

- `actions?<array>`: tour actions array.

  - `target?<string>`: [CSS selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) used to find the target element. default is current step's target.

  - `act?<string | number | function>`: action after event triggered.

    - string: "next" | "previous" | "stop" | "complete"
    - number: same as `step.go(number)`.
    - function: callback function. `function (event, currentstep, curaction)`

  - `event<object | string>`: event details. if you want just use only the event type, set it as a string value, otherwise set it as an object.

    All KeyboardEvent attribute is accepted including `keyCode`, `altKey`, `metaKey`, `ctrlKey` and etc.
    View This doc for more details about the KeyboardEvent: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent

  Example:

  ```js
  {
    ...
    "actions": [
      {
        "target": "body",
        "act": (event, currentstep, curaction, tourguide) => { /* your logic here */ }
        "event": {
          "type": "keyup"
          "keyCode": 39, // arrow right
          "ctrlKey": true // with ctrl key
        }
      },
      {
        "act": "next",
        "event": "click"
      }
    ]
    ...
  }
  ```

> **?\*** indicates the property is optional\*

## Controlling the tour

Once your tour has started you have several ways to manually control the tour flow:

### tourguide.start([step])

Start the tour at any time by calling start(). You may optionally provide the step number to start the tour at a specific step (by default a tour always starts at step 1):

```
tourguide.start(2)
```

### tourguide.stop()

Stop the tour at any moment by calling stop()

### tourguide.next()

Causes tour to go to the next step in the sequence

### tourguide.previous()

Causes tour to go to the previous step in the sequence

### tourguide.go(step)

Causes tour to go to the step specified

```
tourguide.go(2)
```

### Additional properties

- `tourguide.currentstep`: returns the current [step object](#step_object)

- `tourguide.length`: return the number of steps on the tour

- `tourguide.steps`: returns the tour steps as JSON notation

- `tourguide.hasnext`: return true if there are steps remaining in the tour, otherwise returns false

- `tourguide.options`: returns **Tourguide.js** options object

## Attaching callbacks

**Tourguide.js** supports several helpful [callbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function) to help you better control the tour. You may optionally pass the callback functions into the tour instance at initialization time:

```
var tourguide = new Tourguide({
  `onStart:function(options){...},`
  `onStop:function(options){...},`
  `onComplete:function(){...},`
  `onStep:function(currentstep, type){...},`
  `onAction:function(currentstep, e){...}`
});
```

### onStart

Fires when the guided tour is started. The callback function will receive a single param:

- `options`: tour options object

### onStop

Fires when the guided tour stops. The callback function will receive a single param:

- `options`: tour options object

### onComplete

Fires when the guided tour is complete. The callback function will receives no params.

> NOTE: onStop is always fired first, before onComplete is fired

### onStep

Fires when tour step is activated. The callback function receives two params:

- `currentstep`: tour [step object](#step_object)

- `type`: string representing the current direction of the tor; can be one of: "previous" | "next"

### onAction

Fires when user has clicked on the step target. The callback function receives two params:

- `currentstep`: tour [step object](#step_object)

- `event`: [MouseEvent onclick](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event)

## Step object

Each step of the tour is wrapped into a Step class. This allows you to have a direct access to the individual step properties and actions:

- `target`: returns the target element step is attached to

- `el`: returns the step view element

- `show()`: show step element

- `hide()`: hide step element

You can obtain the current step object an any time during the tour execution by calling `tourguide.currentstep` property:

```
var currentstep = tourguide.currentstep;
var stepTarget = currentstep.target;
var stepView = currentstep.el;
```
